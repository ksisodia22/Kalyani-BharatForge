# Kalyani-BharatForge: Centralised Inteligence for Dynamic Swarm Navigation
## Project Description
Its is an autonomous multi-robot system developed using ROS 2 Humble. This project utilizes TurtleBot3 Burger robots for autonomous navigation, communication, and reinforcement learning-based decision-making. The system supports both master-slave swarm architecture and independent robotic operations.

---

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following ROS 2 Humble packages installed:

- `ros-humble-turtlebot3*`
- `ros-humble-navigation2`
- `ros-humble-slam-toolbox`
- `ros-humble-gazebo-ros-pkgs`
- `ros-humble-rviz2`

You can install all dependencies automatically using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y \
ros-humble-turtlebot3* \
ros-humble-navigation2 \
ros-humble-slam-toolbox \
ros-humble-gazebo-ros-pkgs \
ros-humble-rviz2
```

## Project Structure
The repository contains the following key directories:

1. **autobot_recog**: Contains all launch files and node scripts for running the robot system.
2. **communication_msgs**: Contains service and client scripts for inter-robot communication.
3. **RL**: Contains reinforcement learning algorithms for TD3 and PPO.
4. **object_detection**: Contain code files for object detection model.

## Getting Started

### 1. Build the Workspace
Ensure you are in the root of your ROS 2 workspace, then execute the following commands:

```bash
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```

### 2. Launch the Autonomous System

#### Independent Robot Operation
To start the complete autonomous system, run:

```bash
ros2 launch autobot_recog bots_launch.launch.py
```

#### Master-Slave Swarm Architecture
For a master-slave architecture, execute:

```bash
ros2 launch autobot_recog master_slave.launch.py
```

---

### 3. Reinforcement Learning Training

Navigate to the RL directory and choose the desired algorithm for training:

#### PPO Training
```bash
cd RL/ppo
python3 train_ppo.py
```

#### TD3 Training
```bash
cd RL/td3
python3 train_velodyne_node.py
```

---

### 4. YOLO Object Detection Training

Before running the training script, ensure the dataset is prepared. A dummy dataset is included in the repository for reference. To train the YOLO model, run:

```bash
cd object_detection
python3 training_yolo.py
```

## Notes


- Make sure to source your workspace after every build using:
  ```bash
  source install/setup.bash
  ```

- Customize `bots_launch.launch.py` and `master_slave.launch.py` as per your application needs.

- The RL folder contains examples for TD3 and PPO implementations. Modify the scripts for specific tasks.
